To log in on devices like smart TVs, PlayStation, or Xbox, you need an activation code. Do the following:

There will be a screen with an activation code on it.

Use a different device, like a computer or phone, to navigate to the Twitch activation site.

How to Fix Common Login Problems

Invalid Credentials: Check that your username and password are correct. Look for mistakes like typos and the caps lock key being on.

Account Locked: Twitch may temporarily lock your account if you try to log in too many times and fail. Try again in a few minutes or change your password.

Code Not Working on Console or TV: Make sure you enter the right activation code and do it in the time limit. If you need to, refresh the code.

Browser Not Loading: If the login page won't load, try clearing your cache and cookies or using a different browser.

If you're using an authenticator app and 2FA isn't working, make sure your phone's clock is set correctly. If you need to, Twitch support can help you reset your 2FA settings.

How to Log Into Twitch Safely

Keep your passwords safe by using a password manager.

Don't use public devices to log into your account.

After using a shared computer, log out.

Check your Twitch settings often to see what your account is doing.

If you keep your account safe, you can always get to your subscriptions, channel preferences, and content history.
